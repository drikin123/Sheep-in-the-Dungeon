# Rules
The game can be played with two players. One player controls the farmer, using the arrow keys to guide the sheep to the exit. The other player controls the hunter, moving with the "W, A, S, D" keys. The hunter can activate their weapon with the "K" key to burn everything they touch and deactivate it with the "L" key. The "M" key is used to change the visual style of the map, while the "O" and "P" keys allow you to change the appearance of obstacles and fruits, respectively.

It's important to note that wolves can pose a threat by killing other elements in the game, adding a strategic element. The game ends when one of the following conditions is met: there are no more wolves, sheep, or the farmer reaches the exit.
